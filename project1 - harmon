	I am started to get worried about lollipop. I haven't seen
	her since that day she got stung. Everybody is missing her
	a lot. Weeds are growing all over the island. Some villagers
	have been thinking about moving, but they don't want to leave
	without saying goodbye to lollipop.
	
	There have been rumors that she is currently in this place called
	college. I have no idea what that is, but I have heard they have
	you learn and read. I am so jealous of her. I just hope she is
	doing okay.

	This morning, I was reading under one of the trees as usual.
	Then this one human villager (let's call her lollipop) was
	wacking the trees with a net. She hit the tree I was under
	and coincidently a wasp nest fell down and the wasps started
	going crazy. I was scared to death, but they started chasing
	lollipop. She end up getting stung and I felt so bad for her.
	Luckily, she had medicine on her so she is good now.

	I have lived here for some time now, and I am
	still loving it! I have gotten to know the rest of the
	villagers a little more. I don't think some of the villagers
	are too fond of me (usually the moodier villagers) but there
	are some that I adore! If I were to talk about every single
	one of them, we would be here all day, so I have made a little
	chart instead.

	After a hard decision to move away from my home,
	I have finally packed all my stuff and moved to a
	new island. Of what I've seen so far, I think I am
	going to love it here!

	First of all, there are so many apple trees. It's a
	nice change from the pear trees back home. Everybody
	here is also so nice, especially Isabelle. Although I
	feel that one racoon asks for way too much money from me.
